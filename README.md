Django JSON Field
=================

This project was forked from https://github.com/derek-schaefer/django-json-field to add Django 1.9 support. Eventually we should migrate our `json_field.fields.JSONField` to the native Django 1.9 [`JSONField`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/contrib/postgres/fields/#django.contrib.postgres.fields.JSONField), and remove this dependency.
